# causalKit

This package is designed to perform a causal analysis on a given dataset. It focus on determining the relationship between several covariates and a dependent variable of interest. The package contains functions that help identifying potential confounding factors in the data that need to be controlled for in a causal inference analysis. In addition, it also performs interaction and mediation analysis to determine if there are covariates that have an effect on a given dependent variable.
