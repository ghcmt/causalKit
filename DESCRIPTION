Description:
    This package is designed to perform a causal analysis on a given dataset.
    It focus on determining the relationship between several covariates and a dependent
    variable of interest. The package contains functions that help identifying potential 
    confounding factors in the data that need to be controlled for in a causal inference analysis.
    In addition, it also performs interaction and mediation analysis to determine 
    if there are covariates that have an effect on a given dependent variable.
